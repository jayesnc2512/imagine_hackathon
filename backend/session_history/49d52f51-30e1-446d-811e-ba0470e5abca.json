        "assistant": "Given your age, lack of family history, absence of other symptoms, and no known nutritional deficiencies or thyroid/autoimmune issues, premature graying is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nPrognosis:  Premature graying is generally benign and doesn't indicate a serious underlying condition.  Hair color may continue to change.\n\nTreatment: There's no cure for premature graying. Options include hair dye to cover gray hair or acceptance of natural hair color change.  We could explore a blood test to rule out any underlying nutritional deficiencies definitively, but given your answers, it's unlikely to reveal anything significant."
