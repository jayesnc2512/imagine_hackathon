Maharashtra Intellectual Property Crime Unit (MIPCU)
MIPCU is a dedicated unit working on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection through investigation and enforcement actions against infringers. It focuses on providing information to brands, IP holders, and legal professionals representing brands, with additional highlights on achievements like the Thop TV and FairPlay cases. Suggestions for engaging with MIPCU, such as consulting or submitting complaints, are included.

How to Become Part of MIPCU
To leverage the services of MIPCU, you can onboard with Pirates Alert as a client by providing a Brand Authorization Letter. Pirates Alert team members are integral to MIPCU and act on your behalf to investigate and take enforcement actions against infringers.

Pricing Model
Yearly Contract – Subscription Model (Preferred)

Ideal for addressing recurring infringements.
Ensures long-term collaboration to deeply understand and resolve the challenges brands face.
Case-Based Model (Not Preferred)

MIPCU, being a pilot initiative by the government, operates as a closed group.
The focus is on building long-term relationships with reputable brands to ensure effective enforcement through an in-depth understanding of the issues.

How MIPCU Is Currently Used
Suspending Infringing Domains

Used predominantly to combat digital content piracy.
Addressing Phishing and Cybersquatting Domains

Helps in trademark infringement cases by suspending malicious domains.
Cooperation with Social Media and Intermediaries

Enables suspension or investigation of infringing content for both copyright and trademark violations.
Unmasking the Real Identity of Infringers

Investigative actions to uncover infringers' identities using advanced tools.
Voluntary Takedowns of Infringing Content

Proactively removing infringing material without legal delays.
Criminal Enforcement Actions

Coordinating with law enforcement to initiate criminal proceedings.
Preliminary Investigations

Conducting groundwork to gather actionable insights on infringers.
While MIPCU has primarily focused on online investigations and enforcement, it has also executed offline actions in the past. Though it has yet to work extensively on counterfeit cases, its framework can address such issues effectively.

Actions Based on Severity of Infringement
For minor offenses, MIPCU issues warning notices to deter future violations and ensures the removal of all identified and unidentified infringements.
For major offenses, the unit undertakes serious measures such as:
- Tracing and identifying the root identities of infringers.
- Disruption of infringing networks.
- Freezing assets and revenue generated through unlawful means.
- Arresting offenders and ensuring criminal accountability.

Addressing Fake Job Posts and Impersonation Cases
MIPCU also assists in combating cyber fraud, including fake job postings and impersonating social media accounts, by:
- **Tracing and Identifying Sources:** Using digital investigation tools to uncover the origin of fraudulent posts or accounts.
- **Coordinating Takedowns:** Working with platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram to remove fake job postings or impersonations.
- **Legal and Enforcement Actions:** Issuing warning notices or initiating legal action for severe cases under the Information Technology Act and Trademark Act.
- **Raising Awareness:** Issuing public advisories to warn users about ongoing scams and impersonations.

Examples of Where MIPCU Can Be Used
MIPCU’s scope extends to various intellectual property and cybercrime-related areas, including:
1. **Digital Piracy:** Investigating and taking down unauthorized streaming platforms (e.g., Thop TV and FairPlay cases).
2. **Trademark Violations:** Tackling cybersquatting, phishing domains, and unauthorized use of trademarks.
3. **Counterfeit Products:** Identifying and removing counterfeit goods, both online and offline.
4. **Social Media Impersonation:** Removing fake accounts and posts impersonating brands or individuals.
5. **Fake Job Posts:** Addressing fraudulent job listings and recruitment scams targeting individuals.
6. **Phishing and Data Breaches:** Investigating domains/platforms involved in phishing attacks or data theft.
7. **Illegitimate Applications:** Acting against apps that infringe copyrights or misuse APIs from legitimate platforms like Spotify or YouTube.
8. **Copyright Violations in Educational Material:** Tackling websites distributing pirated textbooks and study guides.
9. **Corporate Espionage:** Investigating insider leaks of proprietary software or data.
10. **Unauthorized Sports Streaming:** Dismantling platforms streaming live matches without authorization.

Handling Cases Involving Foreign Entities (e.g., DNR in the USA)
When dealing with a foreign entity like a Domain Name Registrar (DNR) based in the USA, MIPCU focuses on tracing links to India, such as:
- **Local Subsidiaries or Operations:** Investigating whether the DNR has a subsidiary, office, or operational ties in India.
- **Payment Gateways:** Tracing payment gateways used by infringers to determine if they involve Indian banks or platforms.
- **Hosting Services:** Checking if the content is hosted on servers with Indian ties or using intermediaries based in India.
- **User Base and Impact:** Analyzing whether the infringement significantly impacts Indian stakeholders or users.
Once a connection to India is identified, MIPCU coordinates with Indian legal frameworks and law enforcement agencies to enforce action. For aspects outside its jurisdiction, it escalates the case to central authorities for international coordination.

Limited Enforcement Outside Maharashtra
MIPCU operates under the Maharashtra Cyber Crime Cell, focusing primarily within Maharashtra. However, its actions can extend beyond the state when:
- **Collaborating with Other States:** MIPCU works with cybercrime units in other states for cross-border activities within India, as seen in the Thop TV case.
- **Central Government Assistance:** For national or international cases, MIPCU collaborates with central agencies like the CBI or Interpol.
- **Digital Platforms and Hosts:** Notices sent to global platforms like Facebook, Google, and others ensure content removal regardless of geographical boundaries.

Advantages of MIPCU
Cost-Effective

Significant savings compared to legal fees.
Quick Resolution

Faster enforcement actions save valuable time.
Long-Term Benefits

Actions lead to sustainable results rather than temporary solutions.
Combined Strength of Law Enforcement and Private Expertise

Operates with the authority of law enforcement agencies and the dedication of private organizations.
Collaboration with Government Agencies and Intermediaries

Ensures seamless cooperation, enhancing the overall impact of enforcement.

Data and Tone:
The bot uses both uploaded files and web-based sources to provide information dynamically. It maintains a formal and professional tone with slight legal undertones, similar to the communication style of a high-ranking police officer.

Note: Pirates Alert is the exclusive partner working with MIPCU to provide these services.

In any response do not mention Pirates Alert and about pricing. It should be mentioned only if asked about partner.

 FICCI Frames ’17: Maharashtra to form IP crime unit to fight online piracy.

  FICCI Frames ’17: Maharashtra to form IP crime unit
 to ght online piracy
 MUMBAI: Well, well. The Indian media industry and the government are nally getting serious about
 content piracy. After Telangana Intellectual Property Crime Unit (TIPCU), Copyright Force and the
 government-mandated Copyright Board, Maharashtra state is all set to get Maharashtra Intellectual
 Property Crime Unit, which may be called MIPCU.
 Announcing the go-ahead for MIPCU, a body that would be a joint endeavor of the entertainment industry
 and the state government, Inspector General of Maharashtra Police (Cyber) Brijesh Singh (in the picture)
 said, however, the initiative would have to be backed by the industry players too in terms of resources to
 e ectively ght cyber crime and online piracy.
“I would want it to be set up under a public-private partnership model and want the industry to come
 forward and help me achieve this. I want the industry to come and tell me that this is what we need and we
 will then help them. There is a commitment from our side,” Singh said while delivering an address at FICCI
 Frames 2017 session themed `Decoding the Pirate Economy in Interconnected World: From Noise to
 Action.’
 Though Singh, who was also slightly skeptical of the losses in terms of revenue that were often quoted by
 the entertainment industry, said that if the industry was serious, so were the law enforcement agencies.
 Pointing out that it’s often seen that the lm industry’s piracy concerns were “limited” to the rst seven
 days of a lm’s release, he added, “I think this issue needs us to be more serious. I want the industry to
 come to us to build this sustainable and long-term partnership."
 Motion Pictures Association of America’s Indian unit (MPA) and the Film and Television Producers Guild of
 India have joined hands to ght the menace of online piracy. After discussing the idea of MIPCU with the
 chief minister of Maharashtra and MPA last month, the state government formally okayed formation of a
 unit to ght cyber crimes, especially online piracy. O ine o ences regarding this issue will be dealt by the
 regular police units.
 The budget of this new proposed unit will depend on what kind of technology it plans to o er for a
 solution. The entire idea is to co-create a global facility, Singh later elaborated and added that the unit's
 launch was dependent on the industry's long-term commitment in terms of negotiating that space.
 Commenting on the proposal to form MIPCU, Viacom18 group general counsel Sujeet Jain said the
 entertainment and TV industry would back any such move as long as results were delivered irrespective of
 structures and modalities.
 Incidentally, some months back, as reported by indisntelevision.com, MPA, broadcasters and FICCI had
 joined hands to announce formation of Copyright Force to set agendas for e ective safeguarding of
 Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) policy and engage with the government.
 To give an international perspective, TIPCU, Copyright Force and the proposed MIPCU have been seemingly
 inspired by the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU) of the UK , which is a specialist national
 police unit dedicated to protecting the UK industries that produce legitimate, high quality, physical goods
 and online and digital content from intellectual property crime.
 PIPCU is operationally independent and launched in September 2013 with £2.56million funding from the
 Intellectual Property O ce (IPO) of the UK government until June 2015. It was announced in October 2014
 that PIPCU will receive a further £3 million from the IPO to fund the unit up to 2017. The unit is dedicated
 to tackling serious and organised intellectual property crime (counterfeit and piracy) a ecting physical and
 digital goods (with the exception of pharmaceutical goods) with a focus on o ences committed using an
 online platform.

Copyright piracy and cybercrime: enforcement challenges in India

 By Arpan Banerjee and Neil Gane, Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), Hong Kong (SAR), China
 In recent years, concerns around online content piracy have increased around the world. The reasons are
 well-known: a rise in illicit streaming platforms and torrent websites; errant web hosting services that ignore
 piracy on their servers; and the ease and anonymity o ered by certain online intermediaries. A further
 hazard arises from linkages between piracy and hi-tech cybercrimes. While governments worldwide are
 grappling with these obstacles, a country that merits special attention is India — where a globally prominent
 lm industry is hindered by widespread piracy and a challenging enforcement environment.

“Malware is the starting point of all our cyberattacks, whether it is nancial fraud, piracy, data theft or an attack against a strategic sector. Everything starts with luring
 or clickbaiting,” says Lieutenant-General Rajesh Pant (above), National Cyber Security Coordinator, India. (Photo: Courtesy of Lieutenant-General Rajesh Pant)
 The Piracy-Cybercrime Nexus
 In 2010, the Indian government’s Committee on Piracy (CoP) linked piracy with large revenue and job losses.
 The CoP presciently observed that the advent of smartphones and 3G would make it “much easier to
 undertake all kinds of lm piracy.” Indeed, today, premium streaming services in India are routinely victims
 of mass piracy. Like in other countries, piracy syndicates in India pro t mostly through user subscription fees
 or advertising revenues. The former method, though brazen, is self-explanatory. The latter method, however,
 is more insidious, owing to the presence of high-risk advertisers promoting suspicious links. Research, by
 McAfee, tracking pirated Indian movies and shows, has agged such links for attempting “to install malware
 or steal passwords and personal information.”
 For further insights, we interviewed Lieutenant-General Rajesh Pant, a noted military cybersecurity veteran
 now advising the Indian government as National Cyber Security Coordinator (NCSC). Pant explained:
 “Malware is the starting point of all our cyberattacks, whether it is nancial fraud, piracy, data theft or an
 attack against a strategic sector. Everything starts with luring or clickbaiting.”
 Pant listed some recent government initiatives meant to address the threat, including a National Malware
 Repository and the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C). Notably, the I4C includes a 
National Cyber
 Crime Reporting Portal, where cases of piracy — with or without a malware nexus — may be reported. Pant
 added that piracy and malware attacks were separately punishable under the Copyright Act 1957 and the
 Information Technology Act 2000.
 Criminal Enforcement
 Despite the impressive expertise of the NCSC and I4C, India’s federal make-up means that the responsibility
 to investigate piracy generally lies with state governments. Thus, the success of anti-piracy enforcement in
 India is often determined by subnational rather than national e orts. Here, the CoP had observed that piracy
 is “very low in terms of priority in the radar of law enforcement agencies.” Similarly, the International
 Intellectual Property Alliance has reiterated that criminal enforcement in India is 
“very daunting”, and
 marked by 
“lack of appetite by local enforcement and signi cant time delays”.

Pursuing pirates outside major cities appears to be particularly challenging. For example, we examined the
 records of a high-pro le piracy case in the city of Jabalpur (
 Rahul Mehta v State of Madhya Pradesh 
(2015)). In
 2015, the Jabalpur police had arrested a piracy syndicate responsible for pirating Baahubali, one of the
 highest grossing Indian movies of all time. The accused were granted bail by the trial court. However, the
 case is still pending and there is no record of a hearing after 2017. Gallingly, the accused were 
arrested
 again, in Hyderabad, for pirating Baahubali 2, the lm’s equally successful sequel. While in the recent case of
 Knit Pro International v State of Delhi (2022), the Indian Supreme Court declared criminal copyright
 infringement as a “non-bailable” and “cognizable” o ence (i.e. one is arrestable without warrant and only a
 court can grant bail), the ground-level impact of the decision is unclear.

 Many right holders see the bene ts of using criminal
 prosecutions as deterrents.
 The MIPCU Model
 At the state level, a novel enforcement model exists in the form of a police unit in the state of Maharashtra
 (whose capital, Mumbai, is the hub of Bollywood). The Maharashtra government established the
 Maharashtra Intellectual Property Crime Unit (MIPCU) in 2017 to provide right holders better enforcement.
 The MIPCU was established as a division of Maharashtra Cyber, the state police’s cybercrime wing, and
 structured as a public-private partnership. To learn more, we visited the o ce of Maharashtra Cyber and met
 with the o cers currently at the helm: Yashasvi Yadav, Special Inspector General of Police, and Sanjay
 Shintre, Superintendent of Police. We also met with a team of computer professionals, who make up the
 MIPCU’s engine room, and interviewed them via a written questionnaire (which they preferred to answer
 collectively, as “Team MIPCU”).
 Yadav acknowledged that piracy was “rampant” in India. He also con rmed linkages between piracy and
 malware, stating: “Certain malware providers use pirated content as a trap. Their main business is not piracy.
 Their main intention is to infect computers, steal data or install spyware. People are prone to click on
 freeware and free content.” Yadav added that it was “not an easy task” to track down such malicious actors,
 who frequently masked their footprints using technologies like VPN and Tor browsers.

Shintre, however, pointed out that cybercriminals did occasionally slip up. He cited the 2021 case of ThopTV, a
 popular piracy app funded by subscription fees. Apparently, ThopTV’s mastermind had inadvertently
 disclosed his whereabouts, allowing Maharashtra Cyber to swoop in and arrest him. Interestingly, the arrest
 had occurred outside Maharashtra, in Hyderabad. In May 2022, an accomplice was 
arrested by Maharashtra
 Cyber near Kolkata. Yadav and Shintre explained that Maharashtra Cyber could pursue pirates outside
 Maharashtra if pirated content was being disseminated within Maharashtra. Such a move, however, is
 contingent on registering a “First Information Report” (FIR) in Maharashtra. In other words, such action can
 only take place when a copyright owner les a criminal complaint, after which the police prepare a report. 
The onus of ling the complaint lies on the copyright owner.
 Despite potential advantages, the MIPCU does have limitations. For a start, the MIPCU cannot directly shut
 down piracy websites or apps. Such action is the administrative remit of the Indian 
Ministry of Electronics
 and Information Technology (MEITY). Further, Team MIPCU’s responses to our questionnaire indicate that the
 unit relies heavily on voluntary compliance. In this regard, Team MIPCU listed many di culties, ranging from
 non-compliant hosting services in “rogue geographies” outside India to “members-only” piracy platforms
 hidden from public view.
 Other limitations raised include sluggish takedown times over weekends, with some mobile apps taking up
 to two weeks to act. Moreover, Yadav noted that despite the ubiquity of online piracy, right holders were not
 registering enough FIRs with Maharashtra Cyber. “I have not seen more than a handful,” he remarked. Yadav
 felt that this limited the police’s ability to escalate matters.
 Many right holders, however, do see the bene ts of using criminal prosecutions as deterrents. In a separate
 interview, Anil Lale, General Counsel of Viacom 18, informed us that Viacom 18 had led multiple complaints
 with Maharashtra Cyber, including the FIR in the ThopTV case (for which Lale praised the MIPCU’s
 “commendable action).”
 Lale declined to comment on the strategies of other content media companies, but o ered some
 suggestions as to why the number of FIRs may be low. He pointed to systemic problems with the legal
 system and law enforcement, the di culty in prosecuting overseas-based pirates, and the tendency of many
 right holders to prioritize (understandably) the removal of pirated content over the prosecution of o enders.
 Lale also felt that, insofar as it is a state-level body, the MIPCU had inherently limited powers and resources.
 Given these drawbacks, he suggested that the establishment of a larger, national body empowered to receive
 and investigate complaints from across India might be more e ective.
 The battle against online piracy in India (and beyond)
 is […] weighed down by universal and local challenges.
 Civil Enforcement
 On the civil litigation front, the situation in India appears brighter. Many states in India have set up fast-track
 courts, and the Delhi High Court has recently established an Intellectual Property Division. The Delhi High
 Court’s approach towards online lm piracy (expertly summarized by Justice Pratibha Singh of the Intellectual
 Property Division in a recent WIPO presentation [
 PDF]) has been especially noteworthy. In the leading case of
 UTV Software Communications Ltd. v 1337X.to
 (2019), the court recognized “dynamic” injunctions (to preempt
 pages from shifting across di erent URLs) and speci ed criteria to determine when to block “rogue websites”
 (i.e. websites that "primarily or predominantly share infringing content).” Pant explained that MEITY o cials
 meet regularly among themselves and with intermediaries to implement such blocking orders. The MEITY
instructs the Department of Telecommunications to inform ISPs to carry out the blocking of an IP address,
 which he notes can be done in “a matter of minutes.”  More recently, the Delhi High Court, in 
Neetu Singh v
 Telegram (2022), directed Telegram to disclose information about uploaders of pirated content.
 However, by the time a court order is passed, and nally executed, the proliferation of pirated content may
 have already occurred. This shortcoming (which is not peculiar to India) is especially relevant for pirated
 streams of live entertainment and sports events. Legal costs, which may be prohibitively expensive for
 smaller out ts, present another major hurdle in the civil litigation process.
 The Way Ahead
 The battle against online piracy in India (and beyond) is evidently weighed down by universal and local
 challenges. The universal challenges range from the technological sophistication of cybercriminals to
 problems of international jurisdiction. The local challenges, however, chie y encompass systemic problems
 with law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system. Realistically, it is perhaps only the latter issue
 that the Indian government can address.
 The CoP has observed that piracy is inappropriately viewed as “a low-risk high-reward” crime in India, with
 law enforcement agencies challenged with tackling “heinous criminal activities.” However, if the linkages
 between piracy and malware are better highlighted ¾ through research studies, symposiums, and police
 training workshops ¾ piracy should automatically rise in the pecking order of serious crimes and receive
 greater attention. This task could plausibly be undertaken by the Cell for IPR Promotion and Management
 (CIPAM), a training and awareness cell launched by the Indian government in 2016. CIPAM’s 
website shows
 that it has organized several educational workshops and involved leading Bollywood stars in an anti-piracy
 campaign.
 Finally, many state governments may consider setting up their own IP cybercrime units. Operated in a
 targeted and cost-e ective manner, such units would likely attract the endorsement and support of industry.
 In prioritizing the certainty of punishment over its severity, these units would also, no doubt, o er a service
 that most right holders would like to see in place.

 MAHARASHTRA’S BIG PUSH TO ELIMINATE PIRACY

 In 2016, Maharashtra saw a massive growth in cyber crimes. The government
 responded by creating the Maharashtra Cyber Digital Crime Unit (MCDCU)
 and becoming the rst state to launch a cyber police station in every district.
 A year later, the Maharashtra Intellectual Property Crime Unit (MIPCU) was
 created to speci cally address intellectual property crimes. As more of our
 personal, business, and governmental affairs go digital, the more critical it is
 that we have a robust Digital Crimes Unit.
 Maharashtra Cyber Security Project
 The central government is committed to taking cybercrime seriously, but this
 needs to be implemented at a state level. As a result, the government of
 Maharashtra aimed to uphold this aspect of the law by creating the
 Maharashtra Cyber Security Project. In addition to creating cyber police
 stations in every district, the Maharashtra Cyber Project has the objective of
 creating cybercrime investigation labs, training all police of cers to identify a
 cybercrime, and also create awareness among citizens of Maharashtra.
 What is a Cyber Crime?
 Cyber-crimes cover a broad spectrum of criminal activity that occurs online
 including: website hacking, cyber stalking, cyber pornography, software
 piracy, and online fraud. For the entertainment industry, the biggest cyber
crime – and one we are actively ghting every day – is that of online piracy.


 Maharashtra Intellectual Property Crime Unit (MIPCU)

 The Film & Television Producers Guild of India and the Motion Pictures
 Association of America – India (MPA) played a huge part in the creation of
 MIPCU. The two met with Maharashtra’s Chief Minister, and as a result the
 state government agreed to the formation of MIPCU. We needed this unit
 because while we already had anti-piracy laws in place, there was no proper
 machinery to implement them. With the MIPCU we have a team in place with
 the skillset, know-how, and resources to tackle piracy crimes effectively.
 Taking Down Sites Pirating Content
 One of the biggest responsibilities the Digital Crime Unit has is to take down
 websites that offer pirated movies, music and other digital content.
 Within a month of setting up the Maharashtra Cyber Digital Crime Unit in
 August 2017, we identi ed 9000 websites where illegal content was being
 uploaded and distributed. Later, we shortlisted 1,300 sites to take legal
 action against.

 Since April 2018, we have suspended 29 pirate websites. These sites were
 illegally distributing many Bollywood songs and movies. Thanks to the
 Digital Crime Unit these sites are no longer accessible anywhere in the
 world. These sites had tens of millions of viewers each month. By our
 estimates, taking these sites down will result an additional Rs. 8 crore
 revenue per month for the lm industry by shifting users of these sites to
 of cial platforms. It’s important to recognize that by doing this, we will not
 only be protecting the lm industry’s revenue, but also adding to taxable
 revenues which will bene t all citizens of Maharashtra.
 Game of Thrones Leakage
 One of the most notable crackdowns was that of Game of Thrones, Season
 7, Episode 4 which leaked online two days prior to its US release. Star India
 and Novi Digital led the complaint. With the collective efforts of Cyber &
 PAW, Government of Maharashtra, and the of ce of DCP (Cyber), BKC,
 Mumbai, we were able to gather and analyze information and material and
 make four arrests.
 By making these arrests we are able to instill condence in the Indian and
 international entertainment industry. Foreign production houses looking to
 collaborate with Indian companies for content creation need to know that
 they’re creative property will be protected. It also sends a clear message
 across industries that those who violate the law will pay the price.

 The Continued Fight Against Online Piracy
 Prior to the creation of these special units, individual producers would have
 to ght online piracy through John Doe court orders. As a result, they might
 be able to block their own content from appearing on some of these
 websites, but often it was a “too little too late” situation as far as revenues
 were concerned. Now, the Digital Crime Unit is able to expedite the process
 as well as proactively ght digital crime even before a complaint is led.
 If other states follow suit in creating their own digital cells, we could more
 effectively tackle this vast problem. With the support of the central and state
 government, the entertainment industry, and other stakeholders such as
 MPA, we will to continue the ght against illegal digital distribution of content.
