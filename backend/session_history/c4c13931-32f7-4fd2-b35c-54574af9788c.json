Pancreatitis is less likely given the location and lack of radiation.\n\nTo confirm, I need to know if you have any nausea or vomiting besides what you've already described."

Gastritis remains a possibility, but is less likely given the severity and location of the pain.\n\nPrognosis:  With appropriate treatment, the prognosis for a peptic ulcer is generally good.  However, untreated ulcers can lead to complications.\n\nI will prescribe a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) such as Omeprazole to reduce stomach acid production.  You should follow up with me in a week to assess your progress.  It's crucial to avoid foods that trigger your pain.  A follow-up endoscopy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
