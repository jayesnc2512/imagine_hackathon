To help determine the specific cause, I need to know if you have any recent travel history or exposure to sick individuals."

However, bacterial infection (like pneumonia or a urinary tract infection) remains a possibility.\n\n**Prognosis:**  With prompt treatment, influenza typically resolves within a week. Bacterial infections require antibiotics and may take longer to resolve.  A high fever like this warrants immediate attention.\n\n**Treatment:**  I recommend you seek immediate in-person medical attention.  Do not attempt self-treatment.  A doctor will need to perform a physical exam and possibly order blood tests or other investigations to confirm the diagnosis and prescribe appropriate medication, which may include antiviral medication for influenza or antibiotics if a bacterial infection is confirmed.  In the meantime, rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (Tylenol) to manage your fever and discomfort.  **Do not delay seeking medical care.**"
