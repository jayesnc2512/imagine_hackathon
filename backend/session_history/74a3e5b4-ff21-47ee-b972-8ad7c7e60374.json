        "user": "yes heavy bleedin",

However, endometriosis and adenomyosis remain possibilities.\n\n* **Possible Diagnoses:** Endometriosis, Adenomyosis.\n\nTo help differentiate, I need to ask:  Do you experience pain in your lower back or pelvis outside of your menstrual cycle?"
    },
    {
        "user": "no",
        "assistant": "The absence of pain outside of menstruation makes adenomyosis less likely.  Endometriosis remains a strong possibility.\n\n* **Possible Diagnosis:** Endometriosis\n\n**Prognosis:**  Variable, depending on the extent of the endometriosis.  Treatment options include pain management (NSAIDs, hormonal birth control), and potentially surgery in severe cases.\n\n**Prescription:**  I recommend starting with over-the-counter ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin) 400-600mg every 4-6 hours as needed for pain.  If this is insufficient, we can discuss hormonal birth control options.  A pelvic ultrasound is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.  Follow up appointment needed to discuss results and further management."
